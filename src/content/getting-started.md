# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications. It provides features like:

- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- API routes
- File-system based routing
- Built-in CSS and Sass support

## Why Next.js?

Next.js makes it easy to build production-ready React applications. It comes with built-in performance optimizations and developer experience improvements that make it a great choice for modern web development.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Code Splitting

Next.js automatically splits your code into small chunks, loading only what's necessary for each page. This results in faster page loads and better performance.

### 2. Hot Code Reloading

During development, Next.js automatically reloads your application when you make changes, making the development process smooth and efficient.

### 3. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js can render your pages on the server, which is great for SEO and initial page load performance.
